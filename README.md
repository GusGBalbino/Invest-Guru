# 📊 Invest Guru - RAG System for Investment Study and Analysis

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help investors understand financial content and investment-related documents.

This project allows you to upload PDFs such as investor relations reports (RIs), study materials, and financial presentations. A language model (LLM) then answers your questions based solely on the content from these documents — with no speculation or investment recommendations.
